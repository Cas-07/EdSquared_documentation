## Tutor and Student Features

### How do tutors create an admin account?

1. Tutors can create an admin account by signing up on the app.
2. They will receive a verification email.
3. Tutors need to verify their account using the link in the email.
4. Once verified, they can send a verification code to their students to connect.

### What data can tutors and students see?

- **Tutors**: Can see all the data input by their connected students, including grades, confidence levels, and historical records. Tutors can also see and add lesson reports and give feedback per student per subject.
- **Students**: Can see their own data, including grades and confidence levels. Students can also see feedback, lesson reports, and homework added by their tutor.

### How are grades and subjects managed?

- **Grades**: Students can input one grade per subject per day. If a new grade is added on the same day, it will overwrite the previous one.
- **Subjects**: Students must choose from a broad list of subjects before adding grades. The dropdown menu for adding grades will fetch the student's added subjects.

### What can admins do?

- Admins can see all students' confidence levels, grades, and historical records.
- Admins can add lesson reports, which can be seen by both admins and students.
- Homeworks are general per student, but feedback and lesson reports are specific to each student and subject.

### How does the AI feature work for tutors?

- Tutors can input keywords or draft feedback and lesson reports.
- The "Write with AI" feature will enhance and polish the text by replacing the tutor-written text with AI-generated content.
